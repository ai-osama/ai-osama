### Hi there 👋

I am Mohammad Osama, I am an Engineering Graduate from Galgotias University Greater Noida Uttar Pradesh. In the past, I worked as a full-time employee as well as a freelance content developer (contractor) for various Ed-tech companies. During my work, I realized how important data is for a business to keep growing, and I discovered the role of a data analyst/ data scientist/data engineer in utilizing that data using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. This got me excited about working in the field of data.


I started learning the tools and skills required to be a successful data professional and successfully work in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning, or Artificial Intelligence. I have been dedicating the past five months to extensively learning these skills. I have worked on many projects, and get a good knowledge of Python, MS Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL). I am skilled in the various libraries of Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, SciPy, Plotly, and Scikit-Learn) also. Now I have a good knowledge base to work as a data professional. My goal now is to find a company where I can apply my skills and knowledge to help businesses make better decisions and stay ahead by using data-driven insights.
